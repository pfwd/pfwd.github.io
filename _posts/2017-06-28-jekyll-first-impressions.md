This article is being wrtiten during the blog migration from Wordpress to Jekyll and so the opionuns will probbally change as time passes.
The inital benfit is that wrtiting a post such as this can be done in Markdown and thereforce can be written in a IDE.  So there is no need to change from a programming based application to written application unless desired.  This panders to the inner lazy programmer.
However IDE's don't always have the best spell checker and the interface is now littered with debugging buttons and project based furnitory. 

The main frustration so far is the lack of SEO and lack of remebering which articles are drafts and which ones have been published.  I think further investagion is needed into the Jekyll workflow when writting articles.
 
Overall the platfom is quite impressive and extremally fast. There is no CMS and now risk of someone breaking into a database as there is no database to break into.
The fluid templating system is very Twig like which is very easy to pick up having a Symfony background.
